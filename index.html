                <h1 class="title">Git Init</h1>
                <p class="desc">The git init command creates a new Git repository. It can be used to convert an
                    existing, unversioned project to a Git repository or initialize a new, empty repository. Most other
                    Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first
                    command you'll run in a new project.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Git Status</h1>
                <p class="desc">The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area.
                    It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven’t, and which files aren’t being tracked
                    by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history. For
                    this, you need to use git log.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div>
                            <h2>Untracked Files</h2>
                            <p>Untracked files are the ones still not versioned—”tracked”—by Git. This is the state of
                                new files you add to your repository. That basically means Git is aware the file exists,
                                but still hasn't saved it in its internal database.</p>

                            <h2>Modified Files</h2>
                            <p>As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you've changed them since your last
                                commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all
                                those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Git Add</h1>
                <p class="desc">The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells
                    Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add
                    doesn't really affect the repository in any significant way—changes are not actually recorded until
                    you run git commit .</p>

                <p class="desc">The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
                    Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them
                    unless you explicitly ask it to.</p>

                            <p class="desc">To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the
                                directory your repository is stored at.

                                The git remote add command takes two arguments:

                                A remote name, for example, origin
                                A remote URL, for example, https://github.com/user/repo.git
                                For example:</p>

                <p class="desc">The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. Merging remote upstream changes into your local repository is a common task in Git-based collaboration work flows.</p>
